// Integer to Roman

// Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

// Symbol       Value
// I             1
// V             5
// X             10
// L             50
// C             100
// D             500
// M             1000
// For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

// Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

// I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
// X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
// C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
// Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

// Example 1:

// Input: 3
// Output: "III"
// Example 2:

// Input: 4
// Output: "IV"
// Example 3:

// Input: 9
// Output: "IX"
// Example 4:

// Input: 58
// Output: "LVIII"
// Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
// Example 5:

// Input: 1994
// Output: "MCMXCIV"
// Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

//There are literally tons of ways to do this, but this is how I understand it best.
//Big O space: O(n) We use a seperate object to store the numerals and values. This helps constant lookup while in the loop. We also use a return string, but that is required, so a lot of times you don't have to count that into Big O consideration.
//Big O time: O(n) We use a single loop to compare the conversion of num value to numeral and update the return string. This could get messy if we stored our map in an array, or even nested arrays as I have seen before. Yuck!
