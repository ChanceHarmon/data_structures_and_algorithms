# data_structures_and_algorithms

I started this repository to fill the gap I feel JavaScript has in the Data Structures and Algorithms community. <br>
I found it is difficult to research a lot of the problems, and even with a premium Leetcode subscription, JavaScript is vastly under represented.

# Content

The repositiory contains all of the content from a Udemy course on the subject, and most of the exercises are complete.<br>
There is also several leetcode challenges solved, specifically the most popular Amazon questions. 

# How to use this Repository

Hopefully you have node installed, fingers crossed. When you clone the repository, run `npm install` to load the current test suite. Almost none of this has tests written, but for the few that do you can use `npm test <file-name>` after the install. This is something that I look to build out more in the future.<br>
Use it for study and any other projects. <br>
If you would like contribute to this project, feel free to contact me and I can add you as a collaborator. I just ask that <br>
the structure follows the general theme of what is already here, ie ES6, a good explanation of the problem in the comments, <br>
explanation of Big O to the best you understand it, and the thought process of how you arrived at the solution.

# The Future

I will continue to update the repository with new questions as often as possible as I continue to grind away working on job prep. <br>
I hope you find something useful to assit in your own studys, **Cheers!**
